# WeatherPeg

## Your one-stop shop for the current weather in Winnipeg

Everything is included, just run the .exe

There is no exe for Linux, as, obviously, exe's don't run on Linux. weather-cmd-no-speech.py is for Linux. 

I fixed the exe. Check the git blame to see what I did.

Official server of WeatherPeg

source.txt is where you put the link to the XML file for information sourcing. Examples in examples.txt. 

This may work with other weather services, I don't know. It will work for Canadian cities, though. 

Webserver defaults to port 2046, but can be changed in config.txt

https://localhost:2046/weather
